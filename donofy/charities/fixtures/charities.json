This is obviously a serious worry for handlers who have their own financial obligations, and medical bills can be a real challenge.\n\nAs is widely acknowledged, the relationship between a handler and their working partner is second to none, and it is unthinkable that the pair may be broken up due to financial pressure. Unfortunately, this does often happen, and it causes great distress for the handlers, their families, and of course the animals themselves.\n\nSo, the NFRSA is there to help to ensure these wonderful animals can stay where they belong, with the families they love, as the years advance. It's the least they deserve when they've devoted most of their lives to keeping us, the public, safe.",
